			<h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Lang.NET is a forum for discussion of  programming languages, managed execution environments, compilers,  
        multi-language libraries, and integrated development environments. It provides  an excellent opportunity 
        for programming language implementers and researchers  from both industry and academia to meet and share 
        their knowledge, experience,  and suggestions for future research and development in the area of programming  
        languages. 
      </p>
	    <p>
	      Lang.NET 2009 will be held from April 14-16 on the 
	      <a href="http://members.microsoft.com/careers/mslife/locations/corpcampus.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft corporate campus in Redmond</a>.
	      The conference program will focus on the pragmatics and experience of designing  languages, implementing compilers, and building 
	      language tools that target either native or managed execution platforms, such as the DLR, .NET CLR and other implementations 
	      of the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm" target="_blank">ECMA  CLI</a>. That is, 
	      on how to get real programming tools into the hands of  real programmers to solve real problems, and on how researchers and  
	      practitioners can learn from each other to make this happen. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you are a language designer, compiler writer, or tool builder in industry or academia, Lang.NET 2009 is a unique opportunity 
	      to directly interact with the  architects of Microsoft language platforms. Microsoft language technologist  will be very active
	      participants in the conference but at least 50% of the  program is reserved for presentations by non-Microsoft employees.
	      In the evenings there will be ample opportunity for networking during the social events and dinners.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Additionally, this year the Lang.NET Symposium will be followed directly by the 
	      <a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/conference/" target="_blank">Domain Specific Language Developers Conference</a>, 
	      hosted by Chris Sells of Microsoft’s Connected Systems Division. The DSL DevCon will be focused on practical and applied uses of 
	      DSLs and will be taking place in exactly the same building as the Lang.NET Symposium. Attendance for the DSLD DevCon is free, 
	      but you must register in order to attend. Please visit 
	      <a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/conference/" target="_blank">sellsbrothers.com/conference</a> for more information.
